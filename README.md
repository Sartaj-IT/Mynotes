 We learnt 
Network:
     A network is a group of interconnected devices (computers, phones, printers, etc.) that can communicate and share resources (like internet, files, and printers).
Example: Your home Wi-Fi connects your phone, laptop, and smart TV into a local network.
Types: LAN (Local Area Network), WAN (Wide Area Network), etc.

IP Address (Internet Protocol Address):
      An IP address is a unique number assigned to each device on a network to identify and locate it.
* Format (IPv4): 192.168.1.1
* It allows devices to send and receive data over the internet or a local network.
* Two types:
     * Private IP – used inside local networks (e.g., 192.168.0.1)
     * Public IP – used to identify your device on the internet

Subnet (Sub-network):

A subnet is a smaller part of a network, created to organize and manage traffic efficiently.

* Purpose:Divide large networks into smaller, manageable sections.
* Helps improve speed and security by controlling how data flows.
* Subnet mask example:255.255.255.0 tells which part of an IP address refers to the network and which part refers to the device.

MAC ID (Media Access Control Address):

A MAC address is a unique identifier assigned to a network device's hardware (like a Wi-Fi adapter).

* Format:00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E
* It doesn’t change and is set by the device manufacturer.
* Works at a lower level than IP and is used inside local networks for device-to-device communication.
